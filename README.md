7DRL 2014
=========

My annual 7DRL. Lately I've been learning Lisp via Practical Common Lisp.
I'm only about halfway through the book as of the start of the project, but I
decided to give Lisp a go anyways. Should be fun!

Dependencies
------------

```lisp
(require 'asdf)
(require 'asdf-install)

```
